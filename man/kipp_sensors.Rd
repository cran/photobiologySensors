\details{
Kipp CUV 5 Broadband UV Radiometer:
Detection system includes optical filters and a photodiode.

Kipp PQS 1 PAR Quantum Sensor:
Detection system includes optical filters and a photodiode.

UVS-A-T Radiometer, UVS-B-T Radiometer, Kipp UVS-E-T Erythemal Radiometer:
The detection system includes optical filters and a phosphor
that determine the spectral response. The phosphor is very
sensitive to low levels of ultraviolet radiation and is stimulated
by the UV to emit green light, which is detected by a photodiode.
The system is temperature stabilised at +25 Â°C to prevent
changes in spectral response and sensitivity with variations in
the ambient conditions.

\note{
Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. These are approximate
data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.

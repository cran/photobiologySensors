\description{
A vector of indeces for extracting subsets of spectra from the
\code{\link{sensors.mspct}} object.

\details{
In the LI-190 PAR quantum sensor (PAR = photosynthetically active radiation)
colored glass filters are used to tailor the silicon photodiode response
to the desired quantum response.

The LI-200SA features a silicon photovoltaic detector.
This is not a true 'pyranometer' and should be used only in sunlight, and
calibrated in sunlight.

The LI-210SA Photometric Sensor utilizes a filtered silicon photodiode to provide
a spectral response that matches the CIE curve within Â± 5% with most light sources.

\note{
Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. These are approximate
data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.

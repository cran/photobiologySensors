\details{
sglux SG01D-A UV-A broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor).

sglux SG01D-B UV-B broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor, VIS-blind).

sglux SG01D-C UV-C broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor, "solar-blind").

sglux SG01L SiC broadband sensor (SiC sensor not filtered).

sglux TOCON blue 4 blue light broadband sensor (pre-amplified GaP detector).

TOCON preamplified sensors with similar spectral response as the diodes are
also available from sglux. The blue light sensor is only available as
preamplified TOCON.

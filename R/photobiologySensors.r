#' Data for spectral response for different types of broadband sensors are
#' stored as objects of class \code{sensor_spct} as collection members in
#' an object of class \code{sensor_mspct}.
#' In addition to the spectra the package provides character vectors of names
#' to be used as indexes to extract spectra from the collection.
#'
#' Data for angular response for different types of broadband sensors and some
#' diffusers used as entrance optics for spectrometers are stored as objects
#' of class \code{data.frame} as members of a \code{list}.
#' In addition to the list of data frames, the package provides character vectors of names
#' to be used as indexes to extract the data frames from the named list.
#'
#' The data in this package are not original. Some have been provided by
#' authors of scientific publications and manufacturers. However, most of
#' the spectra have been digitized from manufacturer's brochures and manuals
#' available on web sites.
#'
#' @section Warning!:
#' The spectral data included in this package are not all based on supplier's
#' specifications and are only for information. The exact response spectrum
#' depends to some extent on testing conditions, but more importantly varies among
#' individual sensor units. Spectral specifications are usually given as typical
#' values. All the sensors for which data are presented here need periodic
#' calibration. In other words, the data provided here are not a substitute
#' for actual calibration under measuring conditions for each individual sensor
#' unit. For less demanding situations like roughly assessing the suitability
#' of sensors or the need or not of a transfer calibration, the data are good
#' enough. They can be especially useful in teaching.
#'
#' @section Data and their units of expression: Data are normalized to one at
#'   the wavelength of maximum response to energy. Wavelengths are expressed in
#'   nanometres as required by the classes from package 'photobiology' used to
#'   store the data. The User Guide shows how to re-scale and normalize the data
#'   using other criteria.

#' Spectral data digitized from figure in manufacturer's manual.
#' These are typical measured data, and for specific sensor units the
#' calibration data supplied with the sensor must be used as individual
#' units may differ in their spectral response. Furthermore, the digigitizing
#' process from figures with a linear scale is prone to errors, which
#' are specially noticeable in regions of low responsivity.

#' Kipp CUV 5 Broadband UV Radiometer:
#' Detection system includes optical filters and a photodiode.
#'
#' Kipp PQS 1 PAR Quantum Sensor:
#' Detection system includes optical filters and a photodiode.
#'
#' UVS-A-T Radiometer, UVS-B-T Radiometer, Kipp UVS-E-T Erythemal Radiometer:
#' The detection system includes optical filters and a phosphor
#' that determine the spectral response. The phosphor is very
#' sensitive to low levels of ultraviolet radiation and is stimulated
#' by the UV to emit green light, which is detected by a photodiode.
#' The system is temperature stabilised at +25 °C to prevent
#' changes in spectral response and sensitivity with variations in
#' the ambient conditions.

#' Digitized with 'enguage' from manufacturers brochures. These are approximate
#' data, both because of the digitizing process, and because they are
#' either typical values or for a particular sensor unit. Individual sensor units
#' are expected to differ to some degree in spectral response.

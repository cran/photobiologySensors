#' sglux SG01D-A UV-A broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor).
#'
#' sglux SG01D-B UV-B broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor, VIS-blind).
#'
#' sglux SG01D-C UV-C broadband sensor (filtered SiC sensor, "solar-blind").
#'
#' sglux SG01L SiC broadband sensor (SiC sensor not filtered).
#'
#' sglux TOCON blue 4 blue light broadband sensor (pre-amplified GaP detector).
#'
#' TOCON preamplified sensors with similar spectral response as the diodes are
#' also available from sglux. The blue light sensor is only available as
#' preamplified TOCON. Sensors are available in different configurations with
#' different sensitivity and with different angular responses, and encased
#' to resist different environmental conditions.

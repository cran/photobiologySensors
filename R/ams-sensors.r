#' TSL254R light-to-voltage optical sensor combining a photodiode
#' and a transimpedance amplifier, sold as electronic components.
#' The spectral response is nearly identical
#' for type TSL250, TSL251 and TSL252.  (part is no longer in production.)
#'
#' TSL257 high-sensitivity low-noise light-to-voltage optical
#' converter that combines a photodiode and a transimpedance amplifier,
#' sold as electronic components.
#'
#' @note
#' Digitized with 'DigitizeIt' from manufacturers data sheets. This are
#' approximate data, both because of the
#' digitizing process, and because they are either typical values or for a
#' specific sensor unit. Individual sensor units are expected to differ to some
#' degree in spectral response.

Package **photobiologySensors** is a collection of spectral
responsiveness data for different broadband sensors and of angular
response data for some of the same sensors and for cosine diffusers and
other entrance optics used with spectrometers. It complements other
packages in the suite of R packages for photobiology ‘r4photobiology’.
This package contains only data.

## Code breaking renaming of data objects

In the update to version 0.5.0 several members of the collection of
filter spectra were renamed to ensure consistency and clarity. As of
version 0.5.0 all member names start with the name of the manufacturer
or supplier. In addition, several of the vectors of names of member
spectra were renamed to include the word “sensors” to avoid possible
name clashes with other packages and also to improve naming consistency.

## Examples

``` r
library(photobiologySensors)
eval_ggspectra <- requireNamespace("ggspectra", quietly = TRUE)
if (eval_ggspectra) library(ggspectra)
```

How many spectra are included in the current version of
‘photobiologyFilters’?

``` r
length(sensors.mspct)
#> [1] 51
```

What are the names of available spectra? We use `head()` to limit the
output.

``` r
# list names of the first 10 sensors
head(names(sensors.mspct), 10)
#>  [1] "ams_TSL254R"         "ams_TSL257"          "Analytik_Jena_UVX25"
#>  [4] "Analytik_Jena_UVX31" "Analytik_Jena_UVX36" "apogee_s2_131_FR"   
#>  [7] "apogee_s2_131_R"     "apogee_sq_100X"      "apogee_sq_500"      
#> [10] "apogee_sq_610"
```

To subset based on different criteria we can use predefined character
vectors of filter names. For example, vector `licor_sensors` lists the
names of the spectra for sensors from LI-COR.

``` r
kipp_sensors
#> [1] "KIPP_CUV_5" "KIPP_PQS1"  "KIPP_UVS_A" "KIPP_UVS_B" "KIPP_UVS_E"
```

We can use the vector to extract all these spectra as a collection, or
as show below, extract data for PAR sensors from Kipp.

``` r
sensors.mspct[intersect(kipp_sensors, par_sensors)]
#> Object: response_mspct [1 x 1]
#> --- Member: KIPP_PQS1 ---
#> Object: response_spct [202 x 2]
#> Wavelength range 391.431-717.608 nm, step 0.5010399-4.00832 nm 
#> Label: KIPP PQS1 light sensor 
#> Time unit 1s
#> 
#> # A tibble: 202 × 2
#>    w.length s.e.response
#>       <dbl>        <dbl>
#>  1     391.       0.0245
#>  2     392.       0.0327
#>  3     392.       0.0410
#>  4     393.       0.0561
#>  5     394.       0.0650
#>  6     394.       0.0753
#>  7     395.       0.0960
#>  8     396.       0.119 
#>  9     397.       0.134 
#> 10     397.       0.153 
#> # ℹ 192 more rows
#> 
#> --- END ---
```

Please, see the *User Guide* or help pages for the names of other
vectors of names by supplier, wavelength region and of the spectrum.
Summary calculations can be easily done with methods from package
‘photobiology’. Here we calculate mean photon response for two regions
of the spectrum delimited by wavelengths in nanometres. Roughly 99% of
the photons sensed by this sensor are within PAR.

``` r
q_response(sensors.mspct[["LICOR_LI_190R"]], 
           list(waveband(c(400, 700)), waveband(c(700, 800))),
           quantity = "contribution")
#>  R/Rtot[/q]_range.400.700 R/Rtot[/q]_range.700.800[ 
#>               0.988216111               0.008700788 
#> attr(,"time.unit")
#> [1] "second"
#> attr(,"radiation.unit")
#> [1] "contribution photon response"
```

The `autoplot()` methods from package ‘ggspectra’ can be used for
plotting one or more spectra at a time. The classes of the objects used
to store the spectral data are derived from `"data.frame"` making direct
use of the data easy with functions and methods from base R and various
packages.

``` r
autoplot(sensors.mspct[["LICOR_LI_190R"]])
```

## Documentation

HTML documentation is available at
(<https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyFilters/>), including a
*User Guide*.

News on updates to the different packages of the ‘r4photobiology’ suite
are regularly posted at (<https://www.r4photobiology.info/>).

Two articles introduce the basic ideas behind the design of the suite
and its use: Aphalo P. J. (2015)
(<https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14>) and Aphalo P. J. (2016)
(<https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2016.1.15>).

A book is under preparation, and the draft is currently available at
(<https://leanpub.com/r4photobiology/>).

A handbook written before the suite was developed contains useful
information on the quantification and manipulation of ultraviolet and
visible radiation: Aphalo, P. J., Albert, A., Björn, L. O., McLeod, A.
